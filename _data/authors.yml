  bio: "I am a research fellow at the Institute for Development and Peace (INEF) at Duisburg-Essen University, Germany, where I work on the African Non-Military Conflict Intervention Practices (ANCIP) project. My research focuses on the political economy of African regional organizations, such as ECOWAS and the African Union, examining how development funding influences their agency and ownership. I am particularly passionate about understanding how institutions navigate overlapping mandates and complex governance challenges.

Before joining INEF, I was a research fellow at Leuphana University in Lüneburg, Germany, where I investigated institutional overlap among African organizations. This work culminated in the development of a comprehensive dataset on African Regional Economic Organizations. I recently defended my PhD, which explored how overlapping organizations claim legitimacy, with a particular focus on the African Union. During my doctoral studies, I was an affiliated PhD researcher at GIGA in Hamburg and undertook research stays at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the European University Institute in Florence, and the NATO Defense College in Rome. I also conducted extensive field research in Africa and Europe.

I hold an MA in Political Science and International Relations from the Graduate Institute in Geneva, a Master’s in Global Affairs with a concentration in International Security from the American University in Cairo, and a BA in Linguistics and English Literature from Alexandria University. Additionally, I studied at the American University in Washington, DC, and was a visiting scholar at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island.
